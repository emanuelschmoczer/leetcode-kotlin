# Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string `s`, delete the minimum possible number of characters from `s` to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

Example 1:

> Input: s = "leeetcode"
>
> Output: "leetcode"

Example 2:

> Input: s = "aaabaaaa"
>
> Output: "aabaa"

Example 3:

> Input: s = "aab"
>
> Output: "aab"

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

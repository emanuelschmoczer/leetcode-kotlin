# Maximum Matrix Sum

You are given an `n x n` integer `matrix`. You can do the following operation any number of times:

- Choose any two adjacent elements of `matrix` and multiply each of them by `-1`.

Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.

Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using
the operation mentioned above.

Example 1:

> Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]
>
> Output: 4

Example 2:

> Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3],[1,2,3]]
>
> Output: 16

Constraints:

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `2 <= n <= 250`
- `-10^5 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5`

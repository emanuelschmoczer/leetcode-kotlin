# Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

Given an integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by `2`, otherwise, you have to subtract `1` from it.

Example 1:

> Input: num = 14
>
> Output: 6

Example 2:

> Input: num = 8
>
> Output: 4

Example 3:

> Input: num = 123
>
> Output: 12

Constraints:

- `0 <= num <= 10^6`
